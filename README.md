# Guardian

Disclaimer: This project is highly experimental

Experimental password manager that doesnt save the passwords. Its basicaly random password generator but its not random, because seed of randomness is generated from your password you provide.

# Concepts

- Passwords are not stored, they are generated depending on input password and other parameters.
- Algorithm can be implemented in any language so you can have it multiplatform without being affraid of data leak on the cloud.
- Harder bruteforcing - You have to test generated passwords for each bruteforce so its actualy slower than manual bruteforcing

# Todo

- [ ] improve actual password generating
- [ ] Test
